## Name of Project: 
Habitually (subject to change)

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
The purpose of Habitually is to help users disolve bad habits and/or build good habits. It will accomplish this by tracking the user's daily progess. 

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* User can create an account
* Full CRUD functionality so the user can create goals, then update or delete them.
* User can set a desired timeframe for each goal. (ex. Goal: No drinking for the month of October. Timeframe: 30 days) Each timeframe will have a visual representation.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* React/Create-React-App   
* JavaScript/JSX
* React-Icons
* React-Bootstrap
* Luxon
* Node.js
* Webpack
* HTML
* CSS
* TailWind CSS
* Animate.css
* Draw.io/app.diagrams.net
* Git
* Firebase

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* A visual representation for goals that were achieved. Perhaps the user will start with a barren garden and a flower will be planted each time a goal is acheived. 
* An interactive demo where the user has to click to follow along. This demo will have the user create a simple goal, complete the goal, then direct the user towards their garden with a freshly planted flower. Meant to build momentum
* An API that returns random quotes of encouragement. 
* Perhaps a section where the user can journal any breakthroughs as they work towards completing a goal. 
* Refactor and implement to use React-Redux

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* A motivational quotes API
* A Library for garden/planting animation
* TBA

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* Not currently.
